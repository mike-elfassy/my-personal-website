      <h2>Intro to Birdwatching - October 15th, 2022</h2>
      <p>Thanks for joining the bird walk today, together we counted 47 species.<br /><br />We couldn't have asked for better weather; it was warm in the sun yet cool in the shade and that's what fall is all about. The birds appreciated it too and we had solid avian highlights: a Belted Kingfisher rattling over lullwater, close looks at a Cape May Warbler, and visible ruby on a Ruby-crowned Kinglet. Better yet was seeing all the raptor activity, especially the moment when two Ravens, a Peregrine Falcon, and A Red-tailed Hawk all circled over lookout hill. At one point, it seemed like the peregrine nipped at the raven's tail feathers. How cool.<br /><br />Check out the full tally on ebird <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S120720326">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Intro to Birdwatching - May 21st, 2022</h2>
      <p>Thanks for joining the bird walk yesterday, the north walk (pools and ravine) counted 25 species, and the south walk (lullwater and wellhouse) counted 42!<br /><br />For the south walk, Blackpolls, Eastern Kingbirds, and Baltimore Orioles were heard and seen just about everywhere. Nesting birds were abundant as well and it was sweet to watch Robins and Orioles feeding their nestlings! Lastly, two birds gave us a ID challenge: two infrequent birds: an Olive-sided Flycatcher and a molting juvenile Broad-winged Hawk (hard!), both seen by the Monument.<br /><br />Check out the south walk ebird checklist <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S110931915">here</a>. If you have an ebird account, I'm happy to share the list with you, just let me know.</p>

      <h2>Intro to Birdwatching - April 30th, 2022</h2>
      <p>Thanks for joining the bird walk today, together we counted 31 species.<br /><br />We had amazing views of a Green Heron by the lower pool and it was especially cool to watch it hunt and see its crest. In the Ravine, we had other notable sightings: a pair of Tufted Titmice%u2014usually a common winter bird though notably absent this year%u2014a perching female Eastern Towhee, and close looks at a Black-and-white Warbler in the Ravine. Here's the full <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S108513432">checklist on ebird</a>.<br /><br />As a reminder, the Brooklyn Bird Club is hosting our annual spring birdathon on Saturday, May 14th. We'll be raising money for the planting of a bird-friendly native meadow in Green-Wood Cemetery, you can find out more about it <a href="https://givebutter.com/brooklyn-bird-club-2022-spring-birdathon">here</a>. You're all welcome to either start your own team, join mine that will be part of Saturday's walk, or simply to donate to the cause.<br /><br /><u>Here's a photo of today's Green Heron</u>
